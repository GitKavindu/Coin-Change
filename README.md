# Coin-Change
Algorithm for finding different set of permutations to make a number using a given number set.

This algorithm is implemented using coins example.

There is a set of coin values given.
And a total number is also given

Algorithm finds how many permutations of coin sets are there to make that total.
And also it output the permutaion with least number of total coins.

(Imagine there are unlimited supply of a single coin value.)

*  Ex1:-
*       int coinArr[]={1,2,5};
        int coinTotal=10;
*       1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 5 - 2 ,
        num of permutations 10

  
*  Ex2:-
*            int coinArr1[]={1,2,4,10};
             int coinTotal2=12;
*            1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , 4 - 0 , 10 - 1 ,
             num of permutations 18
